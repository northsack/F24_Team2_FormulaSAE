# Formula SAE EV


## Executive Summary

Tennessee Tech Motorsports (TTM) is building its first Formula SAE Electric vehicle, focusing on designing and integrating an electric powertrain that meets competition rules while matching the performance of its gas-powered car. The project includes key electrical systems like the accumulator, motor controller, and safety circuits, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and compliance with Formula SAE standards.

Instead of designing a powertrain from scratch, the team modified components from a 2022 Zero FXE electric motorcycle to fit the Formula SAE car. This allows them to use proven hardware while customizing key systems like the motor controller, shutdown circuits, and safety features. The powertrain delivers 52 horsepower, 55 ft-lbs of torque, a 60 mph top speed, and at least one hour of endurance.

The goal of the team is to build a powertrain system that uses dual throttles to control the speed of a motor. A mechanical engineering senior design team is developing a chassis where the electric powertrain components will be installed.

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing. (delete this line later)

### (In progress)
In the year we worked on this project we have taken the FX Zero motorcycle’s powerpack and have been able to make the proper connections to get it to power our power train system. The power train system includes the FX Zero motorcycle’s motor and the Sevcon Gen 4 motor controller. With our current configuration we have been able to connect and program the motor controller to control the motor speed by accepting inputs from 2 throttle sensors. 


## Salient Outcomes

### Recognitions

Use this space to recognize anyone that you feel has had an impact on the project. Be sure to recognize the work of previous teams if you referenced it for style or content. 

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.


### Reports

Under the reports section, our group's detailed design, conceptual design, project proposal, and more files can be found. Detailed design files are located in their own folder in the Reports directory.

### Documentation

In the documentaion section information regarding the documentation that is required and how it should be organized is given. (delete this line later)

### (In progress)
Our documentation folder contains 4 folders:
	Electrical
	Images
	Meeting Minutes
	Other Files

These folders contain files used in other documents such as our project proposal, conceptual design, and detailed design files.

A description of each folder’s contents are below:

- Electrical - Contains PCB files, and schematics
- Images - Contains block diagrams,  flowcharts, wiring diagrams, as well as demo images used in presentations.
- Meeting Minutes - Contains the meeting minutes files that documented the topics and purpose of all our team meetings.
- Other Files - Contain miscellaneous files such as Gnatt charts.


### Software

No custom software is currently being used for this project.
