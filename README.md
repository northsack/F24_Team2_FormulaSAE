# Formula SAE EV

The descriptions and information in all readme files in the starter repo (including this one) must be edited. All section descriptions must be deleted. Any failure to remove the description information (like the statement that you are currently reading) will be heavily penalized!

## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.


## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing. (delete this line later)

### (In progress)
In the year we worked on this project we have taken the FX Zero motorcycle’s powerpack and have been able to make the proper connections to get it to power our power train system. The power train system includes the FX Zero motorcycle’s motor and the Sevcon Gen 4 motor controller. With our current configuration we have been able to connect and program the motor controller to control the motor speed by accepting inputs from 2 throttle sensors. 


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us
